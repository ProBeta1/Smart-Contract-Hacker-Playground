##Welcome to the Smart Contract Hacker challenge!

There're 2 different tasks for you to tackle, both based on infamous Parity MultiSig wallet.

First you need to make sure you have following dependencies installed:

* Node 7.* with npm
* Truffle 
* Ganache-Cli

Node is [available at](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), to install Truffle & Ganache-Cli run

```bash
$ npm install -g truffle
$ npm install -g ganache
```

Also install package dependencies run
```bash
$ npm install
```

Afterwards launch corresponding challenge script which contains description

```bash
$ ./challenge1.sh
```

OR

```bash
$ ./challenge2.sh
```

And get hacking!
